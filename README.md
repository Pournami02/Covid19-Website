# Covid19-Website
I have built a multiple paged website based on status of COVID-19 in India.The website covers details about COVID-19,district wise COVID-19 statistics,FAQ and a quiz to test whether a person is prone to COVID-19.This is a simple website made using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.The back end portion of the website has not been done.
