		<h3 id='h3'>What is Covid-19?</h3>
			<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. As of 31 May 2020, more than 6.05 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 368,000 deaths; more than 2.56 million people have recovered.The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, most often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances. Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. It is most contagious during the fir			st three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.</p>
		<h3 id='h3'>Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear two to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. Common signs and symptoms can include:
			<ul>
			<li>Fever</li>
		<li>Cough</li>
		<li>Tiredness</li>
		</ul>
		Other symptoms can include:
		<ul>
		<li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
		<li>Muscle aches</li>
		<li>Chills</li>
		<li>Sore throat</li>
		<li>Loss of taste or smell</li>
		<li>Headache</li>
		<li>Chest pain</li>	
		</ul>
		Other less common symptoms have been reported, such as rash, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.Some people may have only a few symptoms, and some people may have no symptoms at all. People who are older or who have existing chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, severe obesity, chronic kidney or liver disease, or who have compromised immune systems may be at higher risk of serious illness. </p>
		<h3 id="h3">Prevention</h3>
		<p>Although there is no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19, you can take steps to reduce your risk of infection. WHO and CDC recommend following these precautions for avoiding COVID-19:
		<ul>
		<li>Avoid large events and mass gatherings.</li>
		<li>Avoid close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.</li>
		<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
		<li>Cover your face with a cloth face mask in public spaces.</li>
		<li>Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue. Wash your hands right away.</li>
		<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
		<li>Avoid sharing dishes, glasses, towels, bedding and other household items if you're sick.</li>
		<li>Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters, daily.</li>
		<li>Stay home from work, school and public areas if you're sick, unless you're going to get medical care. Avoid public transportation, taxis and ride-sharing if you're sick.</li>
		</ul>
