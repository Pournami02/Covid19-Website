		<ul>
			<li><strong>How does the virus spread?</strong></li>
			<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</p>
			<hr>
			<li><strong>Can I get sick with COVID-19 if it is on food?</strong></li>
			<p>Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food.Additional investigation is needed.</p>
			<hr>
			<li><strong>What is community spread?</strong></li>
			<p>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p>
			<hr>
			<li><strong>Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?</strong></li>
			<p>No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It is not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.</p>
			<hr>
			<li><strong>Can someone test negative and later positive on a viral test for COVID-19?</strong></li>
			<p>Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to?protect yourself and others.</p>
			<hr>
			<li><strong>Who is at a higher risk from COVID-19?</strong></li>
			<p>People aged 65 years and older,people who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility,people of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma,people who have serious heart conditions,people who are immunocompromised people with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] =40),people with diabetes,people with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis,people with liver disease etc.</p>
			<hr>
			<li><strong>Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?</strong></li>
			<p>Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it is always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.</p>
